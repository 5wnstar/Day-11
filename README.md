Welcome to world of Python programming. Here you'll learn Python, not only by theory, also by codes.



Note - Before starting the tutorial of Python programming, let's first read all the things provided here very carefully to understand all about Python programming, along with answers of some interesting questions related to Python. I know it will take your crucial time, but trust me, you're investing your time in a right path.

So before starting the series of Python programming tutorial, let's see some world-class application written in Python or some big Multi-national companies (MNCs) that uses Python programming.


1.0 Applications Written In or Uses Python

In IT sector, one of the top company named Google uses Python for its system administration and system building purpose. There are extensive number of applications written in or uses Python programming language. In which these are the list of some famous and well-known applications all over the world:

    YouTube - uses Python programming as its Back-end (server-side) development, along with some other languages that are C, C++, or Java, and Go.
    Google - uses Python programming as its Back-end, along with other languages such as C, C++, Java, Go, and Node
    Facebook - despite of PHP being the core language of Facebook, they also uses Python as its Back-end development, along with other languages such as C++, Java, PHP (HHVM), Hack, Erlang, D, XHP, and Haskell.
    Similarly Yahoo, Pinterest, Spotify, Dropbox, NetFlix, Reddit etc. also uses Python.

Even NASA and SpaceX uses Python programming language for many purposes like testing, automation etc.

If these multi-national companies uses Python, then there must be a big reason behind it. Those big reasons are covered in the What is Python used for ? section, given below. Most of the time, many companies that are using Python because of its versatility and dexterity.


1.1 What is Python ?

Python is:

    an interpreted high-level
    general-purpose
    object-oriented
    procedural
    functional
    structured
    and reflective

programming language. Before going the brief history of Python language, that is, who, where and when the language was developed. Let's talk about some questions, asked by many beginners before start learning Python.

I've answered all those questions related to Python programming, that provides the clear-cut understand on the language, that why and for what the language is used.



That is, if you're learning Python or wants to learn Python, then it is must to know the thing that tells, is it good to invest time in learning Python programming ?
Let's find out.


1.3  Why to Learn Python Programming ?

Despite of many reasons provided below (after this section) to learn or inspire you to learn Python programming, the main reasons are:

    It has extensive community, means that, if any problem gets arise while doing the program in Python or doing any project or whatever you're doing in Python. You can find and get the solution from any where, over the internet because of its large number of community.
    Python has a large number of libraries, that helps to cater all your need
    Python is a highly flexible language, means that it can be used to develop a program works on multiple purposes
    The development speed of a Python program is faster than other languages as it uses less code more productive

Note - Python is one of the most in-demand language all over the world.




1.4  Can Python used for Hacking ?

Yes absolutely, Python is a very powerful language to work on in creating codes for hack purposes. And I must tell you that Python is one of the most loved language used by hackers all around. As it is an open-source language and has extensively great number of libraries.

As I've answered all the questions that must be asked before starting the series of Python tutorial, now it's time to get the background of Python, that who, when and where the language was developed and all such details.



1.5  Who developed Python ?

Python was developed by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer.
Where was Python Developed ?

Python was developed at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), a National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science. This institute is located at Amsterdam Science Park, Netherlands. This institute is popularly known for the creator site of Python programming language.
When was Python created ?

Python was first appeared in February 20, 1991.


1.6  What are the Filename Extensions for Python Source Code ?

Python allows multiple extensions that can be used to name the file. Here I've provided three filename extensions that can be used to name the source code or program written in Python:

    .py - The most used filename extension. I've used this extension for all the Python program created here.
    .pyi
    .pyw

For example, cyberjollof.py
